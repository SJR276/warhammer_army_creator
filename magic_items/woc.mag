Dread Artefacts of Chaos

Hellfire Sword
    Weapon, Melee
    65
    Close combat attacks made with the Hellfire Sword have the Flaming Attacks and Multiple Wounds (D3) special rules. No armour saves can be taken against Wounds caused by the Hellfire Sword. After all close combat blows have been struck, roll a D6 for every foe slain by the Hellfire Sword - on the roll of a 6, the slain foe’s body explodes, inflicting an additional D6 Strength 4 hits on the enemy unit with the Flaming Attacks special rule. Unsaved Wounds inflicted in this way count towards the combat result. At the end of each of the wielder’s turns, roll a D6; on the roll of a 1, he suffers one Wound with no armour saves allowed.

Skull of Katam
    Arcane
    15
    The bearer of the Skull of Katam can choose to consult it before attempting to channel power dice. If he does so, roll 6 dice instead of 1. If the bearer consulted the Skull of Katam, he suffers a -1 Leadership penalty for the rest of the game for every result of a 1 rolled when channelling — if it is ever reduced to 0, he is immediately removed as a casualty. A Wizard with the Mark of Tzeentch may not re-roll channelling results of a 1 when using the Skull of Katam.

Pendant of Slaanesh
    Enchanted
    50
    The bearer of the Pendant of Slaanesh can only join units that have the Mark of Slaanesh. No other character may join the same unit as the bearer and he cannot join units that already contain a character. Whenever the bearer, or his unit, take a Break test, it is taken on one less dice than usual (note that a Break test cannot be passed with Insane Courage on a single D6). In addition, for each unsaved Wound the bearer suffers, he gains +1 Attack for the rest of the battle.

    Each time the bearer, or his unit, suffer a hit from a shooting attack, roll a D6 immediately before rolling To Wound. On the roll of 2+, the Strength of that hit is halved. However, if the result is a 1, the Strength of that hit is instead doubled. Attacks that do not roll To Wound, or that wound automatically, are not affected by the Blasted Standard.

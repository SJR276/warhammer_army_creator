Parsing
-------

* Refactor the parsing system. Current system is ok but needs to be improved on now to make it easier
  to interact with unit objects. Probably want to have enums for each item type standardised across
  both the default equipment and optional equipment for the unit. This will require refactoring of both
  the .ros file format and the roster_parser class methods themselves.

- Finish first basic implementation of parsing for all unit and character types. Infantry and characters
  mostly done - Warbeasts, Monsters, Warmachines and others still to do.

- Implement method in roster_parser for parsing common properties that all units have, then add additional
  parsing rules to the unit specific methods.

Units
-----

- Make cleaner implementation of unit champion handling, currently have no way to indicate that a units'
  champion can have some specific items / other options. Again, needs careful handling in roster parsing
  and .ros files themselves.

GUI
---

- More experimenting with layouts for better scaling behaviour of widgets.

- Once parsing system refactor is complete start designing the unit_options_box element
  of the UI.

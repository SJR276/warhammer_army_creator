Units
-----

* Determine best structure for mixed_unit class - currently storing two normal_unit instances ("master"
  and "slave") but this will likely yield problems. May be better to just compromise with some duplication
  of normal_unit methods but with some specialisation for correctly handling mixed units.

* Store one-choice-only and multiple-choice extras separately.

Parsing
-------

- Once mixed_unit structure is finalised, Implement parsing method for these types.

- Implement method in roster_parser for parsing common properties that all units have, then add additional
  parsing rules to the unit specific methods.

GUI
---

- More experimenting with layouts for better scaling behaviour of widgets.

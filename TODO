Units
-----

* Store one-choice-only and multiple-choice extras separately - requires slight change to parsing.

Parsing
-------

- Implement method in roster_parser for parsing common properties that all units have, then add additional
  parsing rules to the unit specific methods.

GUI
---

- More experimenting with layouts for better scaling behaviour of widgets.
